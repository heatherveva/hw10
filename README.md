## Tests

Each employee file contains its own tests. The employee file is the parent class, the test demonstrates that the information is contained in an object and that each employee type will take a name, id, and email. The three other employee types extend the employee class, becoming the children.

The engineer role intakes a GitHub link, the intern role intakes a school name, and the manager role intakes an office number. These special properties are unique to each of the three employee types.

There are eight total tests for the four employee files and all eight of them pass.
